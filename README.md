# FinalPack - what I have learned from each week:

### Week 1
- First week, we introduced ourselves and shared some background about Linux to each other. Instructor discussed with out what shoul we expect about the course, grade, syllabus, course material where to send the homeworks how to contact the instructor it was very usefull iformation and then we introduce ourselves like our names, majors and linux background that day i remembered i didnt even know what linux is i heared before but it was something new to me.

Here is link of my first Hello World 

[Week One](https://github.com/caqlishire/hello-world)
### Week 2
- What I learned from chapter2 was really wonderful its what i called my first sight of linux it was basic magic commands that each and every linux master used daily life it was usefull and will make my life easy sometimes when i look back my old scrips like this one i release that im come from far.

Here is My Second Script 

[Week Two](https://github.com/caqlishire/week2)

### Week 3
- This week its another important week of my life its the week i think i become a software developer its the week i got to learn virsion control wonderfull platform firts time i heard Github and the three usefull commands Git push, Git commit and Gitpush its the week i got learned repo how to create new repository and work and get involve amazing developers and their work.

Here is what i push that week

Here is what i did that crazy week

[Week Four](https://github.com/caqlishire/Chapter-4)
### Week 5
- This week i learned new chapter called chapter five wich describes the physical and logical structure of a Linux system, what the karnel is, and how to work with processes and also i leanred in thi chapter how the karnel starts or boot and moves into memory up to the point where the first user process starts. using such a powerful commands like GRUB...

Here is my script for that week amazing work

[Week Five](https://github.com/caqlishire/week5)

### Week 6
- This week i learned another edge how user space starts the point where the karnel starts its first user-space process, unit, is significant-not just because thats where the memory and CPU are finally ready for normal system operation, but because thats where you can see how the rest of the system builds up as a whole. i learn System V runlevels and system dependencies.

Here is what i did for that week and i feel after words it was week i did another script that i named week 6A both u can find this link

Here its my script for that week

[Week Nine](https://github.com/caqlishire/week8)
### Week 10
- Week i reviewed all the commands i have learned and put them togather and run it as one script most commands works fine but some of them give me some errors and after peer review and some open issues finally we figured out thank you to all my peers those who have helped me to fix these issues and the teacher as well

Here the script for putting all work togather

[Week 10](https://github.com/caqlishire/midterm)
### Week 11
- This week was understanding and configuration network, and Networkapplications and services connecting copmuters and sending data between them, also understnading what is under the wirest and how this wires work and deliver data, that sounds simple enough, but to understand how really this things works togather need to have some strong foundation like this we discussed this week network basics, Packets, Network layers and Internet layers viewing your computer's IP addresses I was amazed by how great and nicely this week was. I never thought there is such a commands as "ipconfig". I have used it a lot for my later scripts. 
### Week 12
- This Week was Introduction to shell scripts i like the saying If you can enter commands into shell, you can write shell scripts, a shell script is a series of commands witten in afile I aslo read about how does internet work article nice one and downloaded wireshark. I also went through TCPDUMP toturial and i learned that tcpdump is used to capture the traffics passing through your network. I also read chapter 11 and was fun and juicy.We got divided into 3 groups for our final projects. Our group decided to set up a Webs server (abshir Ali) and named our group as [Linux stars] and we did great job check the link for our page and the script that i did that week

### Week 13
- This Week we cover Chapter 12and 13 Moving Files & Chapter 13 UserEnvironments, applying the concepts in your own scripts. it was moving files and sharing files between machines on anetwork, we did started by looking at some ways to copy files other than scp and sftp utilities that we have already seen also chapter 13 user inviroment the system and user have to meet some where, and start up files play an important role at this point, becouse they set defaults fot the shell and other interactive programs they detemine how the system behaves when a user logs in

Here is the script for those chapters togather

### Week 14
-This Week was two thiny chapters chapter 14 and 15 briefly survey of the linux desktop it its quickly introduction to the components foundin a typical linux desktop system. of all the diffrent kinds of software that you can find o linux system, in the desktop arena is one of the wildest and most colorful aslo we covered Development Tools chapter 15 linux and unix are very popular with programmers, not just due to the overwhelming array of tools and enviroments available but also because the system is exceptionally well documented and transparent.  As well week 14, chapter 14 was about Window Managers and chapter 15 was about the C compiler. I learned some commands such as "xwininfo" to see the location of the icon. 
Team contribution: I set up my Pi as a webserver and but i failed to connect to his server at home, I did some research about [TCP vs UDP and SSH port 22] also i did some other reseach for IPXE and netboot i was in two group Ooops Slackers and Linux star and my role was reaserch and support as well check the link below for my script and my team contribution

### Week 15
- As for this week, my team contribution was to write steps on how to install apache2 and deploy the our sootsplash server that our teacher gave as the access also i read and review chapter 16 how linux work Introduction to compilling software from C source code because most nonproprietary third-party Unix software packages come as source code that you can uild and install and one reason forthis is that Unix and linux its self has so many diffrent flavors and architectures that is would be difficult to distribute binary packages for all. check the link below for my work for that week including my weekly script

<p>Im going to put all my work together after dedicated and committed to requirements for the class including, weekly homeworks, group project contributions, Case study, reading the chapters in the book before attending lecture, attending extra classes, doing extra research on website to enhance my understanding, and attending all sixeenthy weeks of class without missing out a single day, and participating in all class activities, groups like Opps and my Linux star both simultaneously.Overall, I really like this ticket. I actully get to play and apply commands as I go. I believe this is how we learn. This is really a book from getting you the concept of the Linux to simple commands to compile them as a script. By working with my classmates was a great experience especially Linux stars and Opps slackers.</p>
